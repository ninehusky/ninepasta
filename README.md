# ninepasta

For the nth time, here's an emojifier.

## Goals

The goal for this project is to have a community-run repository for people to create word-emoji pairs. These word-emoji pairs are then used in the app's playground to easily generate emojipastas!

Later features include an admin page for community moderation! More information on this can be found in the roadmap below.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Entry creation page
- [ ] Entry updating page
- [ ] Entry deletion page
- [ ] Admin access point
- [ ] Typescript refactor

## Special Thanks

Thanks to the folks over at Chakra-UI for making front-end work exponentially less painful than it usually is, and to the homegirl Alexandria for believing in my subpar webdev skills.
